            <p class="about-me-message">Hey, I’m Andrew a designer, brand strategist, and frontend developer based in
                south africa. I vibe with
                clean code, intentional storytelling, and smart systems that actually make sense. Whether I’m crafting
                seamless UI with JavaScript, building structured designs or tweaking markdown documentation at 2 a.m.
                with a coffee in hand. I’m all about making ideas feel intuitive, bold, and just the right amount of
                nerdy.

                My work lives at the intersection of clarity and creativity. I love solving messy problems with neat
                solutions from integrating APIs to building accessible layouts that actually work for people. Think
                functional but make it aesthetic. This portfolio is basically me in code form thoughtful, strategic
                and built to scale with purpose.
